This is a [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) template
for transforming your [GitHub profile
README](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme)
into a simple project dashboard.

## Quickstart

Install the latest Cookiecutter, preferably with Homebrew:

```bash
brew install cookiecutter
```

Then bake your new project and follow the on-screen prompts:

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/benjcunningham/cookiecutter-profile-dashboard.git
```

Finalize plugin setup by:

- Changing directories into the project
- Initializing the Git repo with `git init`
- Creating a remote on GitHub
- Setting the remote URL with `git remote set-url origin`
